# Hey there 👋

I am an **AI Research Engineer** and **PhD Student** in Computational Science & Engineering. My work sits at the intersection of **Applied Mathematics**, and **Deep Learning**.

I specialize in building systems that bridge the gap between theoretical math and practical software engineering, from optimizing tensor decompositions to architecting LLM-driven development tools.
